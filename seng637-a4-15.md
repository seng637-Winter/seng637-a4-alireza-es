# Introduction
## Introduction

Mutation testing is a critical technique in software testing, aimed at enhancing the robustness and reliability of test suites. It involves introducing small, deliberate changes, known as mutants, to the software's code to test the ability of the existing test suite to detect these modifications. Our focus is on applying mutation testing to the `Range` and `DataUtilities` classes from the JFreeChart library, building upon our work from Assignment 3.

Before proceeding with mutation testing, it is essential to ensure that the test suite is fully functional and all test cases pass successfully. During our initial review, we identified and resolved failures in our `RangeTest.java` and `DataUtilitiesTest.java` test cases. Correcting these failures was a crucial step, as a fully passing test suite is a prerequisite for effective mutation testing.

This report outlines our mutation testing process, starting from the necessary pre-processing steps to enhance our test suite, through to the detailed analysis of the mutants and the effectiveness of our test cases.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

# Comments/feedback on the assignment itself
